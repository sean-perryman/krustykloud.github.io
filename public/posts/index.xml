      <description>Well, it was bound to happen at some point. I got a complete OpenStack environment up and running with all the components I wanted, including Ceph (for live migrations and HA). You might be thinking to yourself I should sound happier, and you are right. The performance for this new system is abysmal, at least as far as Ceph goes. 14MB/s on average, where an instance on the local storage is about 85MB/s.</description>

      <description>I spend a fairly significant amount of my time installing and testing different OpenStack deployment methods. As such I am pretty familiar with the documentation, though I will say it hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been that way. When I first started doing this I kind of just tried to yolo it and that ended up not working well. Eventually you learn that you have to pay attention to the documentation, sometimes pretty intently like in the case of Kolla as they are providing you with a couple of different options at the early steps of the process.</description>
