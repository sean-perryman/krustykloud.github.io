I think that in my particular case it comes from a background of hand-holding when it comes to virtualization systems; meaning I am most familiar with Hyper-V and VMware which both hold your hand extensively during the setup and deployment process, and even afterward for maintenance and repair activities.</description></item><item><title>I Finally Got a Complete Openstack Environment</title><link>http://krustykloud.com/posts/i-finally-got-a-complete-openstack-environment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 08:33:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://krustykloud.com/posts/i-finally-got-a-complete-openstack-environment/</guid><description>Well, it was bound to happen at some point. I got a complete OpenStack environment up and running with all the components I wanted, including Ceph (for live migrations and HA). You might be thinking to yourself I should sound happier, and you are right. The performance for this new system is abysmal, at least as far as Ceph goes. 14MB/s on average, where an instance on the local storage is about 85MB/s.</description></item><item><title>The Openstack Documentation Is Not Infallible</title><link>http://krustykloud.com/posts/the-openstack-documentation-is-not-infallible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 11:35:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://krustykloud.com/posts/the-openstack-documentation-is-not-infallible/</guid><description>I spend a fairly significant amount of my time installing and testing different OpenStack deployment methods. As such I am pretty familiar with the documentation, though I will say it hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been that way. When I first started doing this I kind of just tried to yolo it and that ended up not working well. Eventually you learn that you have to pay attention to the documentation, sometimes pretty intently like in the case of Kolla as they are providing you with a couple of different options at the early steps of the process.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://krustykloud.com/pages/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://krustykloud.com/pages/about/</guid><description>Contra vagos Lorem markdownum notam si lintea meque certa en meumque illis, diu fatigant, nec praedae concustodita arcet. Paviunt castris cur errat ventis causa! Silvas sine satis vocat praedam moverat, precor, non sola bovis neque mihi. Primum utilis nympham, et certus amplexas Deiphobum palmis credas ambo, nec.
Excidit gente, si orat suo quaeque dura Calydon nata? Pars auro post stetit adfusique imis amplexus. Agmina per fabricator mittere Erymanthon habetque tot.</description></item></channel></rss>
